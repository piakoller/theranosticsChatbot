Theranostics is a field of medicine that combines therapy and diagnostics. It involves using a single agent to both diagnose and treat a disease. This is often achieved by linking a diagnostic radionuclide (for imaging) and a therapeutic radionuclide (for treatment) to the same molecule. This allows doctors to see where the drug goes in the body and then deliver a targeted dose of radiation to the diseased cells, minimizing damage to healthy tissue. One common application is in the treatment of certain types of cancer, such as neuroendocrine tumors, using agents like Lutetium-177 DOTATATE. Patient safety is a primary concern, and dosimetry is used to calculate the precise radiation dose delivered to the tumor and other organs.
