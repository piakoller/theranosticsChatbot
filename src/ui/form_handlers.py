"""
Minimal Form Handlers Module

This file provides a small, focused FormHandler used by the UI to:
- expose per-section help content
- provide a contextual helper for the chatbot when the user asks about the form
- save form submissions via the existing `conversation_logger` adapter

The goal is to remove unused/duplicated code while preserving the public
interface (`form_handler`) consumed by other modules.
